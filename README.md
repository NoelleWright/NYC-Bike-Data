# NYC-Bike-Data
Purpose:
  The purpose of this analysis is to present bike sharing data for Des Moines to help investors with businesses. The data of this project was broken down by gender and length of travel per bike ride. The data collected helps stakeholders come up with a proposal for bike data selection. Throughout the analysis, jupyter notebook, tableau, and VS code were used to collect and interpret the data sets. 
  
  Results:
    With the results, stakeholders can see that a lot of bike traveling happened in the early morning hours before work as well as in the evening after work. Based off of gender, most bike riders are males. Below, the results from the heat maps show the analysis breakdown for checkout times by users, checkout times by gender, trips by wedekday, trips by gender, and user trips by gender weekday. From the data, more subscribers aretaking advantage of the bike rides and trips. We can see that males are using the bikes more frequently than females and the unknown gender. The data was consistent with the times and the bike range each day and with each gender.
